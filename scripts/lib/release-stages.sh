# Release stages of a train, which stage each unit is in, and the steps that move a train between
# stages. Sourced by common.sh; do not execute.
#
# A train walks alpha → beta → rc → ga, forward only. What a stage means comes from the policy file
# release-policy.json (docs/release-policy.md), never from this script:
#   - units.<unit>.stages              the stages a unit walks when it releases on its own, ending at ga
#   - targets, units.<unit>.targets    where each stage ships: an environment, or a store channel for
#                                      mobile and desktop units. The unit's own entry wins.
#   - units.<unit>.dependsOn           same-repository dependencies the package manifests cannot express
#
# The train as a whole stands at one stage, the line stage. It starts at the earliest stage any boarded
# unit has and moves through the union of the boarded units' stages. Every unit takes its own stage from
# the line stage (train_assign_stages). The line stage is recorded in a Release-Train-Stage trailer on the
# commit that opens the train and on every commit that moves it, because it cannot be recovered from the
# units' stages: a unit that is held back or that follows a dependant can sit at a stage earlier than the
# line. It is not a config key, because release-please's config schema accepts no keys it does not know.

# release-please 依「commit 觸及哪些路徑」歸屬 Release-As，所以這個 commit 必須觸及本單元路徑；又不能
# 是空的，因為空 commit 會被歸屬到所有路徑（src/manifest.ts 的 CommitSplit includeEmpty: true），一個
# 單元的 Release-As 就會污染其他單元。標記檔為此存在，時間戳讓重跑時仍產生真實 diff。它只活在發布
# 分支上，merge-back 會先刪掉再算差異，不進 main。
# 發布套件時標記檔還在單元目錄裡，所以每個套件單元的打包設定都要讓它不進套件：
#   - npm：package.json 的 files 白名單不列它。
#   - crates.io：Cargo.toml 寫 exclude。有 include 時 cargo 忽略 exclude，改成不把它列進 include。
#   - PyPI：uv_build 只打包模組目錄，不會收進它。換成會收整個目錄的後端（例如 hatchling）時，
#     sdist 要排除它。
# 核對方式：cargo package --list、npm pack --dry-run、解開 uv build 的產物，都不該出現 .release-marker。
