# Open a release train: create release/v<line> for a Release Plan and scope release-please to the train's
# units. Every unit gets the stage the policy file (release-policy.json) gives it at the train's first stage,
# so units of one train can sit at different stages. advance-release.sh moves the train on, forward only.
#
# usage: cut-release.sh --plan vX.Y.Z --units product-web,product-api,product-sdk-core [--from main|vX.Y.Z] [--hub-dir <path>] [--yes] [--dry-run]
#   --plan     the Release Plan this train ships (releases/release-plan-vX.Y.Z.md). The plan must be the next one
#              after the latest plan (plan.sh check). The train's product line is X.Y of the plan and names the
#              branch release/vX.Y. The opening commit records the plan in a Release-Plan trailer, which
#              advance-release.sh and finalize-release.sh read the product version from.
#   --units    comma list of units in this train (any axis: apps, packages, libs). A unit with no commits since its
#              last tag simply does not release. Two kinds of unit are added on top of the list: units that
#              depend on a listed unit, and units a prerelease unit depends on that have changed (see below).
#   --from     base: main (default) or a product tag such as v1.3.0, for a post-GA hotfix train.
#              Once the line has a vX.Y.Z tag, --from must name its latest one.
#   --hub-dir  local clone of the primary repository, where a member repository reads the plan from (default:
#              the directory next to this repository named after product.primary in the policy file).
#
# The first stage of the train is the earliest stage any of its units walks. Each unit then takes the last stage
# of its own policy stages that is not after that, or its first stage when it has none (a unit that only has ga
# ships its final version right away). A unit that a unit in a prerelease depends on, and that has changed, follows
# that unit's stage to ga instead; a dependency that has not changed is not boarded. The stage of each unit is
# written into the config as its own versioning and prerelease-type, and the train's stage into a
# Release-Train-Stage trailer on the opening commit. A unit the first stage has not reached is deferred: it
# stays out of the config, and the Release-Train-Units trailer remembers every boarded unit.
#
# No version is pinned here: release-please's prerelease strategy derives each unit's own next
# version from its own commits, which is what keeps unit versions independent of the product marker.
# The config's prerelease-type is "<stage>.1", which the strategy appends to a unit's first bump
# (1.3.1 + feat → 1.4.0-alpha.1); a unit that never shipped starts at its initial-version plus the stage: the
# initial-version its config entry already has (0.1.0-alpha.1), else the product line (<line>.0-<stage>.1).

# maintenance line is also "new" relative to the line it was cut from).

# What boards, on top of --units, until nothing more is added:
#   - workspace dependents: node-workspace only bumps packages present in the config, so a dependent
#     left out of the train would keep a dependency range pointing at the old version.
#   - linked-versions group members: the group shares one version, so it boards all or nothing.
#   - the facts aggregate (the config entry at path "facts", when that directory exists): every train
#     carries it, and release-please releases it only when commits touched its path.
#   - dependencies that have changed since the previous cut, of a unit that is in a prerelease: they follow
#     that unit's stage (train_assign_stages), so what is validated is the set shipping together. A dependency
#     that has not changed stays out.
# They feed each other (a pulled-in dependent may belong to a group, and a group member has its own
# dependents), hence the fixpoint loop rather than one pass of each. The stages depend on the boarded
# units, so each pass recomputes them.
