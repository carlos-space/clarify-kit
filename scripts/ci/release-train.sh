# The versions the open Release PR of a release branch is about to release, as a line for $GITHUB_ENV:
#   FACT_KIT_TRAIN=--train <component>=<version> --train <component>=<version> ...
# On a release branch the facts are pinned to those versions before the Release PR merges, while `describes`
# still reads the old version from .release-please-manifest.json. `fact-kit check --train` lets since be as new as
# the train. Prints nothing when the branch has no Release PR.
#
# The set is release_pr_units (scripts/lib/release-pr.sh): the units whose manifest version on the Release PR's
# head differs from the release branch's, with the PR's version. Only units that have a component package in
# facts/ are kept, because the others have no `describes` for --train to match.
#
# usage: release-train.sh
#   env: BRANCH  the release branch, e.g. release/v1.2 (for a pull request, its base branch)
#   git must be able to fetch origin. The checkout keeps no token, so the CI step passes the read-only token to
#   git through GIT_CONFIG_* in its own environment (.github/workflows/ci.yml, job facts).
